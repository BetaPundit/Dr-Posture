# Dr-Posture

## Introduction 
Dr. Posture detects body posture using your web camera and classifies your posture to be **correct** or **incorrect**. 

It is based on the open source library, [posenet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) to help detect body postures in real time. 

It uses **ml5.js**, build on top of **tensorflow.js** to apply machine learning classification algorithms to classify the detected pose into **Correct** or **Incorrect** seating posture. 

It uses **p5.js** to plot realtime keypoints in the body and remder it in HTML canvas element.
